# Yelp Recommendation Application

Keywords: graph, graph traversal, shortest path, API, caching, Flask, Python


I build a program that matches users preferences with recommended restaurants, and returns information about restaurants connectivity and the shortest paths between restaurants in the network. This program asks users about the type of restaurants and location they are looking for, and return the most desired restaurants using graph algorithms. Users are able to type in the type of restaurants and locations they are looking for in the form, and choose graph traversal (bfs/ dfs) and shortest path algorithms (bellman ford/ dijkstra).
